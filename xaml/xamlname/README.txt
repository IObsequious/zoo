   XamlName Grammar

The following is the normative grammar for a string that is used as a name or key in Silverlight.

Remarks

Characters are restricted to the lower ASCII range, and more specifically to Roman alphabet uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the underscore (_) character.

The Unicode character range is not supported.

A name cannot begin with a digit. Some tool implementations prepend an underscore (_) to a string if the user supplies a digit as the initial character.

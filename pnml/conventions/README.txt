PNML grammar, version 2009
The earliest (non standardized) version of PNML was 1.3.2. It does not support the now required concept of Page in PNML models. It does not support the family of High-level Petri Nets ( Symmetric Nets and High-level Petri Net Graphs).

Version 2009 is the current active version of PNML grammar. You may download the entire grammar in one archive.

RELAX NG implementation of the Conventions Document.
These conventions are short cuts for label definitions. They are
used for simple data or if the label data is not really specified.

Grammar
Here you can find the grammar for the Gosu programming language. The grammar below uses the following EBNF-style conventions:

[x] denotes zero or one occurrences of x.
{x} denotes zero or more occurrences of x.
x | y means one of either x or y.

An ANTLR v3.x based grammar can be found here: https://github.com/gosu-lang/gosu-lang/tree/master/gosu-core/src/main/java/gw/internal/gosu/parser/ebnf

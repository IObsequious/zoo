Objective Modula-2
Benjamin Kowarsch, Tue May 19, 2009 07:58

ANTLR v3 grammar for Objective Modula-2, a hybrid of Modula-2 and Smalltalk, using Objective-C as a blueprint. The grammar may still get a few minor tweaks but is mostly final as of May 2009. Any minor updates will be posted to the same URL. The Objective Modula-2 reference compiler is being written by hand, but ANTLRworks has been used in the design stage as a rapid grammar prototyping and validation tool.

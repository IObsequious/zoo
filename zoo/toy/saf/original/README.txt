Super Awesome Fighter

A novel application of metaheuristic search to the derivation of computer game characters with desirable properties.

The Game

The 'Super Awesome Fighter' (SAF) game was developed to illustrate Model Driven Engineering (MDE) concepts to high-school students. The game is played between two human-specified fighters, or a human-specified fighter and a pre-defined (or 'non-player') opponent. A human player specifies their fighter's behaviour using a bespoke Fighter Description Language (FDL) which covers aspects such as the power of the fighterâ€™s kick, the reach of its punch, and whether the fighter punches, kicks, walks towards its opponent, or runs away in particular situations. The description of both fighters is provided to the game engine at the beginning of the game and interpreted using MDE tools. Play then proceeds automatically, and at each stage of the game, the game engine decides on the appropriate action for the fighters according to their FDL descriptions. The winner is the fighter with the best 'health' at the end of the game.

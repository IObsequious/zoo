* Java LBNF definition *
************************

This is my first attempt at an LBNF definition of the Java 1.1 syntax.
	A good portion of the following code is translated from two sources:
	http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~mckeeman/cs118/notation/java11.html and
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/syntax.doc.html

To use this file, download BNF Converter at:
http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~markus/BNFC/

Please send bug reports/fixes to mrainey@uchicago.edu.  Both are greatly
encouraged!  If you're enterprising, maybe update this definition to 
Java 1.5 ;)

Yacc to TXL grammar converter

Description:
	A TXL program to help transform Yacc grammars to
	TXL grammars.  This can help get you started with
	handling a new language using TXL.

	Tokens are not handled, and must be added by hand.

	The resulting grammar is a first approximation, 
	and must be tuned to TXL form since Yacc grammars
	are very poor TXL grammars.

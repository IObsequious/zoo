OpenQVT 0.1
date : 2005/08/09
Domain : QVT
Description :  This metamodel describes the structure of OpenQVT. The QVT Structure layer introduces common OO structuring concepts that can be easily shared by existing or new QVT languages and QVT frameworks. Such a common foundation is important to model explicitly the inter-operability between distinct tools possibly implementing a variety of formalisms and paradigms. This layer only exposes structuring concepts any excludes any behavioral concern. Note that this level does not need to be standardized since the common Core of the infrastructure library shared by MOF and UML 2.0 already represents it. The next upper level is the QVT Languages and Frameworks. Any language or any framework, which is compliant with the structuring concepts defined in the previous layer, is positioned here. The TRL language (a renaming of MTRANS), proposed for specifying precise mappings in the OMG specifications, is an example. However, other approaches may be used. A transformation program may be written using a programming language such as Java or Python and use various structural patterns packaged in a transformation framework. The highest abstract layer is QVT interoperability, which introduces a component view of transformations, allowing them to be integrated or combined within transformation assembly lines.

PNML grammar, version 2009
The earliest (non standardized) version of PNML was 1.3.2. It does not support the now required concept of Page in PNML models. It does not support the family of High-level Petri Nets ( Symmetric Nets and High-level Petri Net Graphs).

Version 2009 is the current active version of PNML grammar. You may download the entire grammar in one archive.

RELAX NG implementation of PNML Extensions package.
This package is meant to define specific extensions to 
PT-Net type that would appear mostly as tool specific
features. Those features are not semantically speaking essential
to the exchange of PNML models.

PNML grammar, version 2009
The earliest (non standardized) version of PNML was 1.3.2. It does not support the now required concept of Page in PNML models. It does not support the family of High-level Petri Nets ( Symmetric Nets and High-level Petri Net Graphs).

Version 2009 is the current active version of PNML grammar. You may download the entire grammar in one archive.

Extensions
It is possible to extend PNML schema in any way suitable to your specific need. However, as we said on the presentation page, your new defined type will not yet be standard-compatible. This situation will last until part 3 of the standard defines a coherent theoretical and practical framework to do so, in order for standard-compliant tools to automatically discover and read without any ambiguities, Petri net models according to your new type.

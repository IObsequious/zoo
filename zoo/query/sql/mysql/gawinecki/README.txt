SQL grammar for MySQL dialect (ANTLR v3)
Maciej Gawinecki, Wed May 13, 2009 01:18

I've started to work on MySQL dialect of SQL grammar as I haven't found anything like this on the net. Unfortunately, the grammer is currently incomplete as I don't have time to continue the project due some deadlines and other projects.

ISO SQL 2003 Grammar 
Douglas Godfrey, Wed Apr 13, 2011 08:38

This is an initial pass at converting the ISO SQL 2003 grammar to Antlr. The Lexer works but the Parser grammar cannot compile due to infinite look-ahead. If someone would like to work on resolving the problems I encountered, please do so and post your fixes so everyone can use them.

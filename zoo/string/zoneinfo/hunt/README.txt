Zoneinfo parser
Christopher Hunt, Sun Apr 3, 2011 15:57

Zoneinfo TZ is a Java time zone library that parses zoneinfo files and produces a JDK compatible facade for returning time zone information. The library uses ANTLR to parse the zoneinfo files. The grammar it defines can be used beyond just this project.

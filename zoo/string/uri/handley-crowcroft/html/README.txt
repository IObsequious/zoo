Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Grammar

BNF syntax

This is a BNF-like description of the Uniform Resource Locator syntax. A vertical line "|" indicates alternatives, and [brackets] indicate optional parts. Spaces are represented by the word "space", and the vertical line character by "vline". Single letters stand for single letters. All words of more than one letter below are entities described somewhere in this description.

The "generic" production gives a higher level parsing of the same URLs as the other productions. The "national" and "punctuation" characters fo not appear in any productions and therefore may not appear in URLs.

The "afsaddress" is left in as historical note, but is not a url production

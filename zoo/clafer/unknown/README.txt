Unfortunately, the process of obtaining this grammar is a mystery.
* on 15 June 2012 it was committed to the SLPS repository
* there was no accompanying documentation
* the grammar looked like it was copy-pasted from a PDF
* on 16 June 2012, the Grammar Hunter was fixed/improved, which led to some changes in the recovered grammar
* on 16 October 2014, the grammars were moved to the modernised Grammar Zoo
* one person to blame for all these actions: Vadim Zaytsev, http://grammarware.net

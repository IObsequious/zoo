Clafer
v0.3.7

Clafer is a general-purpose lightweight structural modeling language developed by GSD Lab, University of Waterloo, and MODELS group at IT University of Copenhagen. Clafer can be used for modeling of static hierarchical structures but has no support for modeling the change of the structures over time (behavior). The main goal of Clafer is to make modeling more accessible to a wider range of users and domains.

There are many possible applications of Clafer; however, three are prominent:

Product-Line Modeling - aims at representing and managing commonality and variability of assets in product lines and creating and verifying product configurations. Clafer naturally supports multi-staged configuration.

Multi-Objective Product Optimization - aims at finding a set of products in a given product line that are optimal with respect to a set of objectives. Clafer multi-objective optimizer generates a Pareto front of optimal product configurations.

Domain Modeling - aims at improving the understanding of the problem domain in the early stages of software development and determining the requirements with fewer defects. This is also known as Concept Modeling or Ontology Modeling.

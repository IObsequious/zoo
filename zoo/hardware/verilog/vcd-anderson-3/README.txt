ValueChangeDump
Eric W. Anderson, Thu Nov 24, 2011 08:43

Parses VCD (Value Change Dump) files generated by Verilog and VHDL simulators and some logic analyzers.  Accompanying code to interpret the AST is available at https://github.com/ewa/ad9510spi .

Grammar for Verilog four-state Value Change Dump (VCD) files, based
on IEEE Std 1364-2001 (Verilog Hardware Description Language),
Chapter 18.

NOTE that I've taken some liberty with the lexer rule for
identifiers (id_code and reference): The spec allows any
combination of printable ASCII characters as id_code, but that
makes for some serious lexing conflict.  I've excluded a digits, b,
B, x, X, z, Z, #, and $ as initial characters -- I've never
personally seen a VCD file use any of those characters to begin an
id_code, but it's legal to do so.

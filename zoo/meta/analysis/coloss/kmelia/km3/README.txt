Kmelia is a component specification model based on the description of complex services. Kmelia components are abstract, independent from their environment and therefore non-executable
Kmelia can be used to model software architectures and their properties, these models being later refined to execution platforms. It can also be used as a common model for studying component or service model properties (abstraction, interoperability, composability). Kmelia main characteristics are: components, services, software architectures, protocols, contracts, specification of complex interaction between services.
Keywords: component model, services, software architectures, protocols, contracts...

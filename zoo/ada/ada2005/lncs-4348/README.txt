Annex P (informative): Syntax Summary, pages 675..692

The PDF is of a rather poor quality, one needs to pay attention to the order of the lines when copy-pasting.
Some whitespace also gets messed up, but the extractor copes with it.


------------------------
src.semantics.txt was semi-automatically created to encompass the following rule from ยง1.1.4 (p.6,l.14):

	If the name of any syntactic category starts with an italicized part, it is equivalent to the category name without the italicized part.
	The italicized part is intended to convey some semantic information. For example subtype_name and task_name are both equivalent to name alone.

Converted to ANTLR 4 by Terence Parr. Unsure of provence. I see
it commited by matthias.koester for clojure-eclipse project on
Oct 5, 2009:

Seems to me Laurent Petit had a version of this. I also see
Jingguo Yao submitting a link to a now-dead github project on
Jan 1, 2011.

Regardless, there are some issues perhaps related to "sugar";
I've tried to fix them.

This parses https://github.com/weavejester/compojure project.

I also note this is hardly a grammar; more like "match a bunch of 
crap in parens" but I guess that is LISP for you ;)

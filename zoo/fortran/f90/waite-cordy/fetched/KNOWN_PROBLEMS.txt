% Known problems
% - cannot handle F77 sequence numbers and other stuff in columns 73-80,
%   for example, in the example file Examples/F77/ma28.f
%   (workaround: run the separate program f77trim.txl to trim first)
%
% - even though TXL can accurately parse LabelDoStmts, it can't always get
%   the indentation right in the output for the ending label line
%
% - this grammar is still a syntax checker, as the original Eli grammar is.
%   since TXL grammars are normally used for processing valid programs,
%   it would probably make more sense to remove all the Fortan local restrictions
%   to make a more lenient, consistent and simpler grammar
%
% - clearly cannot handle all nonstandard Fortran extensions and vendor
%   dialects.  In particular, canot handle programs using working precision (_WP) 
%
% - lexing of Hollerith constants (e.g. 3Hx y) is an approximation,
%   and cannot handle Holleriths with commas in them
%
% - although contiuations are handled in in the input, they are not preserved
%   in the output since TXL has no way to express it

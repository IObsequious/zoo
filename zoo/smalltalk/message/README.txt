Smalltalk Message Passing Syntax (subset)
Benjamin Kowarsch, Fri May 22, 2009 08:59

This grammar describes the basic syntax of Smalltalk message passing with nested receivers, colon and non-colon identifiers but without operators. It could serve as a base for a complete Smalltalk grammar or as is for a Smalltalk inline facility in a hybrid language (such as Objective-C).

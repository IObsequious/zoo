A grammar for GHC External Core.

(c) Aarne Ranta 2003 under GNU GPL.

The grammar is in Core.cf and it is compiled with

  bnfc -m Core.cf ; make

To test it on an ext-core file, either do

  hugs -P.:/home/aarne/BNFC: TestCore.hs

  hugsprompt> runFile pModule "<file.hcr>"

or, if the file is big,

  ghc --make -i/home/aarne/BNFC TopCore.hs -o TopCore

  ./TopCore <file.hcr>

replacing /home/aarne/BNFC with your BNFC directory in both cases.

I guess there will be some problems with qualified/unqualified
identifiers depending on GHC version. Mine is fairly old, 5.02.2.
The .hcr files in the package core.tgz are generated by that,
so they will work at least.

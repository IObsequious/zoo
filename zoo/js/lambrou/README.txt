ECMAScript
Chris Lambrou, Fri Mar 28, 2008 13:38

I couldn't get the ECMAScript by Greg Clemenson on the Grammar List page to work. It's supposed to run in v3.0 without any issues, but I ran into a whole host of problems. Since I'm fairly new to ANTLR, I thought I'd work my way through Terence's book and have a stab at writing a JavaScript grammar from scratch as a learning exercise. Well, I've reached a point where the script may be useful to others. It compiles cleanly, without any warnings.

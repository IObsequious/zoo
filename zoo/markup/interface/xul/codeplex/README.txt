Project Description

XUL Schema - Add code completion feature to your IDE when developing Firefox Add-ons.

Current Status

Full schema source and Visual Studio templates available.
The schemes are fairly complete - currently should implement all XUL features up-to Gecko 13. Most of the schema is derived from XUL_Reference on MDC and some parts by developing extensions. If you find errors or you have suggestions for improvement please submit them in the issue tracker.

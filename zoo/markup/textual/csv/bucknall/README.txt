The quality of the grammar is typical to that of a handwritten throwaway non-executable helper: it was written in an attempt to understand the structure, not to generate grammarware automatically. This leads to unnoticed misspellings and inconsistent notation.

Grammar fetched, extracted, connected and added to the Grammar Zoo on 1 Apr 2014 by Vadim Zaytsev.

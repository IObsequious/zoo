C# 4.0 preprocessor, lexer, and parser
Christian Wulf, Mon Apr 30, 2012 06:32

I developed a C# 4.0 lexer (incl. preprocessor) grammar and a C# 4.0 parser grammar. In addition to the pure parser, I added a parser grammar with rewrite rules and operands defining an AST structure. Moreover, I included JUnit test cases.

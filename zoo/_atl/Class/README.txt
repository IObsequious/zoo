Domain : Object-oriented programming
Description :  This metamodel describes simple class schema models (OOP). It consists of classes having a name which they inherit from the abstract class NamedElt. The principal class is the class Class, which contains a set of attributes of the type Attribute and has the super references pointing to superclasses for modelling inheritance trees. The class DataType models primitive data types. Class and DataType inherit from Classifier which serves to declare the type of Attributes. Attributes can be multivalued.

OS PL/I V2R3 grammar Version 0.1

Copyright (C) 1999 Ralf Lämmel (CWI, Amsterdam) & Chris Verhoef (WINS, Universiteit van Amsterdam)
This grammar has been been recovered from IBM's OS PL/I V2R3 Language Reference (Document Number: SC26-4308-02) automatically.

Disclaimer 
This grammar is not yet corrected nor completed. It merely represents the portion of syntax covered by the syntax diagram in the referenced document. It does not make sense to derive a parser from the current version automatically. However, this grammar is already used by other people for island parsing in the context of reengineering.

If you have any remark or a question, contact the authors of this grammar: Ralf Lämmel (CWI, Amsterdam, Email: ralf@cwi.nl) & Chris Verhoef (WINS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Email: x@wins.uva.nl). This is version 0.1 (the first version) of the grammar. It has been released on December, 13th, 1999. This document is maintained by Ralf Lämmel.

Acknowledgement 
The system LDL supporting language-centric software protoyping has been used for nearly all aspects of specification/implementation in this project, namely grammar recovery and generation of the actual browsable grammar.

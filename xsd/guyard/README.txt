XSchema 1.0
date : 2005/07/06
Domain : XML
Description :  This basic metamodel describes XSchema. DTDs have limited expressiveness and it is necessary to experiment with new ideas in schema design. These ideas include a syntax that is more like that of XML document content, certain kinds of extensibility and a cleaner separation between parsing and verifying. XSchema is an experimental schema language designed to provide a starting point for these experiments.

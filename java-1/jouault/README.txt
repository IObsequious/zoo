JAVA 1.1
date : 2005/03/18
Domain : Object-oriented programming, Java
Description :  This simplified metamodel of Java consists principally of JavaElements which all have a name. A JavaClass has Methods and Fields and belongs to a Package. Methods, Fields and JavaClasses are subclasses of Modifiers and therefore indicate whether they are public, static or final. JavaClasses and Methods declare with the isAbstract attribute whether they are abstract or not. PrimitiveTypes and JavaClasses are Types. A Method has a Type as return Type and parameters of certain Types. A Field has also a Type.

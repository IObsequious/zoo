date : 2005/04/12
Domain : Object-oriented programming, Java
Description :  This basic metamodel represent Java source code. Java sources are modelized by a JavaSource element. This element is composed of ClassDeclarations. Each ClassDeclaration is composed of MethodDefinitions. Both ClassDeclaration and MethodDefinition inherit from the abstract NamedElement class (which provides a name). A MethodDefinition is composed of MethodInvocations (a call to a method). Each MethodInvocation is, in its turn, associated with a one and only MethodDeclaration (the called method).

Fixes that were necessary for extraction:

	see correct.xbgf
	
	There are various layout problems (say, ";" formatted in italics),
	but we don't even care because we copy-paste the raw text anyway.
	The biggest one is in Â§A.9 [gram.class.derived] where the keyword
	"virtual" is displayed as a nonterminal symbol.

Full copyright information including the copyright information for the underlying Ada 95 Reference Manual are found here.

This grammar has been derived from the Ada 95 Reference Manual.
Lexical and context-free syntax has been separated.
Some informal explanations have been implemented in the lexical syntax.
The nonterminal range has been renamed to range_definition to avoid collision with the keyword range.
There are many unresolved bottom sorts carrying over from the Ada 95 RM.

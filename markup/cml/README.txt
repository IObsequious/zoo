CML 1.0
date : 2005/06/22
Domain : Chemical, XML
Description :  This metamodel describes CML (Chemical Markup Language). It is based on the 1.0 DTD of CML. CML deliberately does not cover all chemistry but concentrates on molecules (discrete entities representatable by a formula and usually a connection table). It supports a hierarchy for compound molecules (clathrates, macromolecules, etc.). It also supports reactions, and macromolcular strucures/sequences (though it can interoperate with other macromolecular XML languages as they are developed). It has no specific support for physicochemical concepts, but can support labelled numeric datatypes of several sorts which can cover a wide range of requirements. It allows quantities and properties to be specifically attached to molecules, atoms or bonds.

NB by Vadim Zaytsev:
	src.language.specification.txt contains the raw grammar copy-pasted from the all "Syntax:" sections of the PDF
	src.manually.fixed.txt         contains the same grammar with some layout fixed by hand
	                               both are provided so that everyone can assess the extent of manual changes

XML 1.0 (Second edition) Grammar and Well-formedness Checker
Hongyu Zhang & Jim Cordy
Source Transformation Project
Queen's University
August 2001

This grammar and well-formedness checker will parse and match
XML tags for any XML 1.0 document.  They can be used as the basis
for any XML transformation in TXL.

See XML/README.txt for the original unchanged read me file.
Grammar extracted and added to the Grammar Zoo on 2 April 2013 by Vadim Zaytsev.
(The definition of the 'cdsect' nonterminal was massaged in order to make TXL parse the XML_Element.Grammar grammar)
Examples from the original archive are not included.

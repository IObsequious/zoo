XSLT 1.1
date : 2005/06/13
Domain : XML
Description :  This metamodel describes XSLT which is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. It is an extension of the XML metamodel. The main class is called XSLTNode and inherits from ElementNode. The XSLTNode class has sub classes representing XSLT elements, namely xsl:apply-templates, xsl:template, xsl:if, xsl:value-of. For reasons of simplification, several features such as xsl:for-each, xsl:choose, xsl:sort, xsl:copy-of elements have been ignored; this is why these are neither in the metamodel nor in the transformation code.

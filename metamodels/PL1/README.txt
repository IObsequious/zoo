PL/1 0.1
date : 2005/08/11
Domain : programming language
Description :  This basic metamodel describes PL/1. PL/1 (Programming Language One) was developed as an IBM product in the mid sixties, and was originally named NPL (New Programming Language). Until the time this new language was developed, all previous languages had focused on one particular area of application, such as science, artificial intelligence, or business. PL/I was not designed to be used in the same way. It was the first large scale attempt to design a language that could be used in a variety of application areas.  Significant Language Features: PL/1 is completely free form and has no reserved keywords;  It precisely defines it is data types without regard for any hardware; PL/1 is a block-oriented language, consisting of packages, begin blocks, and statements. This type of structure allows the programmer to produce highly-modular applications; PL/1 contains control structures. For example, SELECT...WHEN...OTHERWISE allow logical operations, and DO statements allow units to be executed unconditionally one time, forever, or while a condition is true or until a condition becomes true; PL/1 supports arrays, structures, unions, arrays of structures or unions, structures or unions of arrays, and combinations thereof; PL/1 provides four different storage classes: AUTOMATIC, STATIC, CONTROLLED, and BASED.

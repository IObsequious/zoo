WorkDefinitions 0.1
date : 2005/08/10
Domain : Software Process
Description :  This metamodel, inspired by the SPEM initiative, describes work definitions. A work definition is an abstract entity. It is a model element (stemming from the ModelElement package) that describes a work unity (that can be composed of other work definitions). It specifies the operations to apply on work products in a well-defined role context that will have to realize it.  A work definition always comes together with constraints: Goals and Preconditions. Those constraints are defined as Boolean expressions over Work Products states related with the Work Definition. They indicate beginning and ending conditions for the execution of the Work Definition.

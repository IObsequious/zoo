Statecharts 1.0
date : 2005/08/03
Domain : UML
Description :  This metamodel describes Statecharts which consist of three primary items: States: distinguishable conditions of existence that persist for a significant period of time, Transitions: means by which objects change states in respond to events and Actions: atomic behaviors, simple statements such as a++ or invocation of operations defined within the context object or other objects (they are executed behaviors at various points in a state machine, such as when an event triggers a transition, when a state is entered, or when a state is exited).

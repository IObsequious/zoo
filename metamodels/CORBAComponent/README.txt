CORBAComponent 1.0
date : 2005/08/09
Domain : Software engineering, software component, distributed computing
Description :  This metamodel describes a subset of CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) which is a standard for software componentry. The CORBA standard is created and controlled by the Object Management Group (OMG). It defines APIs, communication protocol, and object/service information models to enable heterogeneous applications written in various languages running on various platforms to interoperate. CORBA therefore provides platform and location transparency for sharing well-defined objects across a distributed computing platform.

Make 0.3
date : 2005/07/06
Domain : Build tool
Description :  A metamodel describing the build tool Make: Make is a UNIX utility intended to automate and optimize the construction of programs. It can help develop programs when they consist of many components or source files. A descriptor file, namely makefile, describes the relationship among source files and provides commands for updating each file. Make invokes makefile to automatically rebuild a program whenever one of the source files is modified. It only recompiles the files that were affected by changes, thus saving compiling time. This helps reduce the likelihood of human errors when making entries from the command line. Apart from compilation, make is an effective tool for program installation and system configuration changes.

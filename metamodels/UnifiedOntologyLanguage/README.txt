Unified Ontology Language 1.0
date : 2005/08/10
Domain : Ontology
Description :  This metamodel describes Unified Ontology Language. An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. Formally, an ontology is the statement of a logical theory. We use common ontologies to describe ontological commitments for a set of agents so that they can communicate about a domain of discourse without necessarily operating on a globally shared theory. We say that an agent commits to an ontology if its observable actions are consistent with the definitions in the ontology. The Knowledge Level is a level of description of the knowledge of an agent that is independent of the symbol-level representation used internally by the agent. Knowledge is attributed to agents by observing their actions; an agent knows something if it acts as if it had the information and is acting rationally to achieve its goals. The actions of agents (including knowledge base servers and knowledge-based systems) can be seen through a tell and ask functional interface, where a client interacts with an agent by making logical assertions (tell), and posing queries (ask). Pragmatically, a common ontology defines the vocabulary with which queries and assertions are exchanged among agents. Ontological commitments are agreements to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner. The agents sharing a vocabulary need not share a knowledge base; each knows things the other does not, and an agent that commits to an ontology is not required to answer all queries that can be formulated in the shared vocabulary.

ODP Engineering Viewpoint 0.1
date : 2005/12/01
Domain : 
Description :  The Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) provides a general framework for the standardization of open distributed processing. RM-ODP defines five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment: enterprise, information, computational, engineering and technology. They divide the system design according to several areas of concerns, each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system, and allow different stakeholders to observe the system from different perspectives. In particular, the ODP engineering viewpoint is concerned with the architecture required to support the distribution of the system and its constituent components. The Engineering Viewpoint Metamodel defines the ODP Engineering Language, and conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.906 | ISO/IEC Committee Draft 19793 (Use of UML for ODP systems specifications) a standard that defines how to use UML to represent the ODP viewpoint languages and concepts.

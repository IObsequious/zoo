Amble 1.1
date : 2005/05/30
Domain : Distributed programs, Objective Caml library
Description :  This metamodel describes Amble which is a distributed programming language based on Objective Caml. Amble enables to specify a distributed program in terms of processes that run concurrently. These processes are designed as states machines that are connected to each other by means of networks. Each network specifies a set of channels. The source process of a channel is allowed to write to its target process. An Amble program is composed of a single .ml file that includes the definition of the different process types that are involved in the program, as well as a set of .topo files (one for each considered network) that specifies the topology of the defined networks.

date : 2005/08/04
Domain : Microsoft, Project Management
Description :  This metamodel is a simplified metamodel of Microsoft Project. Microsoft Project (or MSP) is project management software developed and sold by Microsoft.  It is designed to assist project managers in developing plans, assigning resources to tasks, tracking progress, managing budgets and analyzing workloads. Microsoft Project creates critical path schedules, schedules can be resource leveled. The chain is visualized in a gantt chart. Resource definitions (people, equipment and materials) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool. Each resource can have its own calendar which defines what days and shifts a resource can work. Resource rates are used to calculate resource assignment costs which are rolled up and summarized the resource level. Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources. Microsoft Project schedules task work based on the resource availability as defined in the resource calendars. All resources can be defined in a enterprise resource pool. Microsoft Project creates budgets based on assignment work and resource rates. As resources are assigned to tasks and assignment work estimated, Microsoft Project calculates the cost equals the work times the rate. This rolls up to the task level, then to any summary tasks and finally to the project level.

Description :  This metamodel is presented by Guido Wachsmuth in the paper Metamodel Adaptation and Model Co-adaption. The metamodel captures a Petri net. A Petri net is composed of several places and transitions (at least one place and one transition). Each transition has at least one input place and one output place. Arcs between places and transitions are explicit.

Author: A Malton, University of Waterloo, Feb 2002
Based on the TXL release ANSI C 7.0 grammar by
J.R. Cordy, Queen's University, January 1994

This is a TXL base grammar for C, including
   * ANSI features (e.g. literal string concatenation)
   * old-style (K&R) function parameters

but excluding:
   * preprocessor directives
   * comments
   * C++ features
   * string literal 

C and C++ style comments are accepted but not parsed.

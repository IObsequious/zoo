Yacc to TXL grammar converter
C. Xie, Software Technology Laboratory, Queen's University
April 1994 (Rev July 2010)

A TXL program to help transform Yacc grammars to
TXL grammars.  This can help get you started with
handling a new language using TXL.

Tokens are not handled, and must be added by hand.

The resulting grammar is a first approximation, 
and must be tuned to TXL form since Yacc grammars
are very poor TXL grammars.

See Yacc/README.txt for the original unchanged read me file.
